# Call for papers

## Possible titles:
### Comparative Cultural Evolution: Language, Art, Technology
### Cultural Evolution in Language, Art and Technology

University of Tartu
June XX, 2018

Research in cultural evolution has made great advances in finding a common language to discuss evolutionary mechanisms of culture, as well as finding a popular appeal for it. With some agreement in the fundamentals, the particular applications become increasingly interesting, for example:
•	Does cultural evolution work the same way in different domains - e.g. arts, technology and language? 
•	What is the role and relative influence of various biases, selection pressures or attractors in our cultural history?
•	Has there been historical times when these influences have been stronger or weaker?
•	What does this say about the future of our culture?

We would like to invite contributors to a 3-day conference on the cultural evolution in arts, technology, or language in Tartu, June XX, 2018. The aim of the conference is to present and discuss the case studies in various domains of culture. We hope that a gathering of researchers working on particular topics within cultural evolution may spark new thinking on the commonalities and differences of the cultural evolution mechanics in different contexts.

We would like to invite contributions including (but not limited to) the following topics:

•	Cultural evolution research focussed on particular domains, such as:
o	evolution of arts (music, visual arts, etc.);
o	evolution of stories (folkloristic, literary, cinematic);
o	evolution of technologies (ancient and modern);
o	evolution of languages (spoken, written, etc.);
o	evolution of collective intelligence (e.g., accumulation of knowledge, progress in science, etc.).
•	Comparative analyses of cultural evolution in different domains.
•	The importance and role of the focal concepts (e.g., cumulative culture, transformation vs. replication, vertical vs. horizontal transmission) for various domains.
•	Quantitative modelling/methods in cultural evolution - increasing precision and usability.
•	How do we apply the evolutionary models in a way that maintains the expertise developed in humanities and cultural studies so far?
•	Collaboration with related disciplines and among cultural evolution researchers.

Abstracts should be sent to [conference-address]@gmail.com by Feb 1 [+ 2-week extension until Feb 14]. Abstracts should be no longer than 300 words (+ references). The submissions can specify their preferred format to present: 1) 20+10 min presentation; 2) 5 min lightning talk; 3) a poster presentation. The committee will aim for a speedy review and we will return a notification of acceptance by March 1.

The conference will aim to provide enough time and settings for discussion - formal and informal. In addition to showcasing research, one of the goals will be to consider more thoroughly the perspectives and challenges for applied work in cultural evolution.
